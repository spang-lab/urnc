convert:
  solution: "solutions/{notebook.name}"
  # Path where solutions should be copied to, when converting a notebook. If not
  # specified, no solution will be created. You can use {notebook.name},
  # {notebook.stem} and {notebook.suffix} as placeholders. Example: assuming the
  # notebook is stored at "C:/users/me/mycourse/mylecture.ipynb", then
  # - {notebook.name} == mylecture.ipynb
  # - {notebook.stem} == mylecture
  # - {notebook.suffix} == .ipynb
